                        <h4>Oklart</h4>
                        <p>Oklart is an web based weather application developed as project to acquire a Bachelor degree in media technology. It was
                            developed together with a team of other students.
                            <p>The main focus is to visualize the margin of error in the weather data
                        from a source by bringing in nearby areas to the calculation. For example: If the data says it will be 20°C in Norrköping
                        but the nearby areas vary from 12°C to 25°C then the possibility of Norrköping having exactly 20°C is rather small.
                        The application aims to demonstrate this trough showing the user the value and including an area of potential.</p>
